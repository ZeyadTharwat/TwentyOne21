            In design thinking, there's a growing recognition of the value of
            embracing the unconventional. This phenomenon often called the
            'Power of Weird,' represents a departure from traditional norms and
            a celebration of the unexpected. But what exactly does it mean to
            harness this power, and how can it be applied in the context of
            design thinking?
          </p>
          <p>Let's go deeper.</p>

        <div className="space-y-5">
          <h1 className="font-bold text-3xl">
            So... what is the 'Power of Weird'?
          </h1>
          <p>
            At its core, the 'Power of Weird' encompasses embracing novelty,
            originality, and non-conformity in the creative process. It's about
            challenging conventional wisdom, questioning the status quo, and
            exploring uncharted territory. In design thinking, this approach can
            lead to breakthrough solutions, disruptive innovations, and truly
            memorable experiences for end-users.

        </div>
        <div className="space-y-5 mt-8">
          <h1 className="font-bold text-3xl">Do more... with more.</h1>
          <p>
            One of the key drivers behind the 'Power of Weird' is the
            recognition that diversity of thought leads to more robust and 'out
            of the box' solutions. Creatives can tap into a rich reservoir of
            creativity by encouraging themselves to bring their unique
            perspectives, experiences, and ideas to the table. This diversity
            brings about a culture of experimentation, risk-taking, and
            open-mindedness, essential ingredients for driving creativity in
            design thinking.

            Creativity through constraints.
          </h1>
          <p>
            Paradoxically, embracing the 'Power of Weird' often involves
            imposing constraints on the creative process. By setting boundaries
            and limitations, designers are forced to think outside the box and
            explore unconventional solutions. This approach encourages
            resourcefulness, ingenuity, and lateral thinking, pushing teams to
            find innovative ways to overcome challenges and achieve their
            objectives.
